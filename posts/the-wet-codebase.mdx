In the world of programming, there's one phrase that's ubiquitous: "it depends."
It applies to everything from best practices to anti-patterns and even the
widely-praised DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In this blog post, Dan
Abramov shares his insights on why blindly pursuing a DRY codebase may not be
the best approach. As he emphasizes, understanding the trade-offs is crucial in
determining whether a practice is truly beneficial or not. So, before we follow
any good practice, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons and ensure that
we're making informed decisions.
