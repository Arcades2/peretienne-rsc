# TanStack gets bigger

Once again, [Tanner Linsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley) and his team
are releasing a new library accompanied by a promotional video..

<Tweet id="1738709130213560497" />

I was so hyped when I saw this. I'm a devoted fan of Tanner's team and their work,
especially [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), so I had
to give it a try.

# File based routing

The first feature that caught my attention was the file-based routing. While
code-based routing is also possible, the library recommends against it.
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the directory-centric approach in Next.js, so
the flat routing structure here appealed to me. After experimenting with it, I
realized that embedding data fetching, suspense fallback component , and error
handling within route declarations could make code-based routing somewhat
challenging to maintain.

Let's see those file conventions :

- `__root.tsx`: This serves as the root route of your app and is mandatory. It
  must reside at the root of your "routesDirectory" (defaulting to "routes")
- `.` separator: Use the dot separator to create nested routes. For example,
  `users.profile.tsx` will generate a route `/users/profile`.
- `$` token: Employ the dollar token to create dynamic routes. For instance,
  `users.$id.tsx` will result in a route `/users/:id`.
- `_` prefix: Routes segments starting with an underscore will create "layout"
  routes. For example `_private.profile.tsx` will create a route `/profile`
  that is nested under a private layout.
- `_` suffix: Segments ending with the _ suffix exclude the route from being
  nested under any parent routes. For example, if there is a route `users.tsx`,
  creating a route `users_.profile.tsx`ensures that our profile page won't be
rendered as a child of`users.tsx`, making them more like siblings.
- `(folder)` folder name pattern: To group some routes without influencing the
  URL, you can create a folder like "(posts)" and inside group all routes
  related to posts.
- `.lazy.tsx`: You can use the `.lazy.tsx` extension to code split route
  components. `blog.post.lazy.tsx` will be used as the component for the
  `blog.post.tsx` route.

The existence of `.lazy.tsx` files is due to the library not yet handling code
extraction automatically.You have to split your code manually between
"Critical" (path parsing, search param validation, loaders, ...) and
non-critical ones (route components)

So, for a route with a loader, it looks like this :

_routes/blog.post.tsx_

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { getPost } from "../api/posts";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/blog/post")({
  loader: async () => {
    return await getPost();
  },
});
```

_routes/blog.post.lazy.tsx_

```tsx
import { createLazyFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createLazyFileRoute("/blog/post")({
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // ...
}
```

Yeah..., kind of weird to have two files for a single route. It is for sure
different than other lib but I did not have looked at it in the long term.
Second, it is v1 so maybe, one day, we would have code-extraction to colocate
loaders and components.

## Type safety

What about type safety? Well, it's as robust as ever with Tanner's team.

Here is a Link component:
Take for example the `Link` component.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <Image src="/typesafe-link-path.png" width="488" height="129" />
  <Image src="/missing-params.png" width="671" height="163" />
  <Image src="/link-typesafe-params.png" width="1085" height="80" />
</div>

Search parameters can be validated with `zod` and thus be type-safe, as is imperative navigation!

<Image src="/typesafe-search-params.png" width="866" height="949" />

**It's incredibly reassuring to know that you can't go wrong with links, search
parameters, dynamic routes, and more.**

# Data fetching

The library is also handling data fetching at route level. While `react-router`
has been doing that since v6, it doesn't do it in a type-safe manner. Loaders
offer an efficient means of fetching data, as all nested route loaders are
invoked in parallel. As stated in the documentation, "The router is the best
place to coordinate these async dependencies, as it's usually the only place in
your app that knows where users are headed before content is rendered."

So, let's see how it looks like :

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <div>
    <em>routes/characters.$id.tsx</em>
    <Image src="/character_page_loader.png" width="1399" height="785" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>routes/characters.$id.lazy.tsx</em>
    <Image src="/character_page_component.png" width="1259" height="781" />
  </div>
</div>

And guess what ? The return of `useLoaderData` matches the expected type:

<Image src="/useLoaderData.png" width="821" height="461" />

In addition to the features offered by react-router, this library provides
caching. Here are the pros and cons extracted from the documentation:
TanStack Router Cache Pros:

- Built-in, easy to use, no extra dependencies
- Handles deduping, preloading, loading, stale-while-revalidate, background refetching on a per-route basis
- Coarse invalidation (invalidate all routes and cache at once)
- Automatic garbage collection
- Works great for apps that share little data between routes
- "Just works" for SSR

TanStack Router Cache Cons:

- No persistence adapters/model
- No shared caching/deduping between routes
- No built-in mutation APIs (a basic useMutation hook is provided in many examples that may be sufficient for many use cases)
- No built-in cache-level optimistic update APIs (you can still use ephemeral state from something like a useMutation hook to achieve this at the component level)

It is much than decent but if you think you need something more robust, let's add to the stack tanstack/query !

# Perfect fit with React Query

I am a big fan of `react-query` and I am so happy to see that `@tanstack/react-router` is a perfect fit with it.

First, I declare my queries (Please read this cool (as always) blog post by TkDodo : [The Query Options API](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/the-query-options-api)):

<Image src="/query-options.png" width="997" height="954" />

Then, I use them in my loader:

<Image src="/loaders-characters.png" width="757" height="367" />

`ensureQueryData` will either return the data is already in the cache or fetch it.

Finally, I can use the `useQuery` hook in my component (specifically the
useSuspenseQuery hook to avoid managing loading and error states):

<Image src="/component.png" width="861" height="947" />

Viewing it in this light may seem a bit verbose for no apparent gain, but it
brings some benefits:

- The cache is shared between the router and the rest of the app.
- I can use the `useQuery` hook in nested components without prop drilling.
  While @tanstack/router does offer a
  [`getRouteApi`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/code-splitting#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-routeapi-class)
  to retrieve route info like loader data, my component
  must be within that specific route. Utilizing react-query makes it easier to
  move my component anywhere in the app. If the route where it fits doesn't
  have the necessary data fetched, the useQuery hook will handle it.
- I can perform optimistic updates and mutations with react-query.

# Private routes

One common requirements is managing private sections of the app.

Here's what I've found, though I'm not entirely sure it's the best approach:

_routes/\_private.tsx_

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { meQueryOptions } from "../queries/users";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_private")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ context }) => {
    const me = context.queryClient.ensureQueryData(meQueryOptions);

    if (!me)
      throw redirect({
        to: "/",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
  },
});
```

So, it is a layout route where in the `beforeLoad` function, I check if the
user is currently logged in. If not, I redirect to the home page with a
`redirect` function. The `search` object is used to pass the current location
to the home page so it can redirect back to the private page after the user
logs in.

Just need to prefix all private routes with `_private` and you are all set. (`_private.profile.tsx`)

# Conclusion

TanStack Router looks amazing. It is a bit different than what we are used to
but it seems to be for the best. Typesafety is at the center of the lib and it
is so good. Data fetching is also handled in a very efficient way and it is a
perfect fit with `react-query`. I am so excited to see where it will go and I
am sure it will be a big success.

If I have an SPA project to start, I would definitely give it a try and make me
even more dependent to TanStack libraries !
