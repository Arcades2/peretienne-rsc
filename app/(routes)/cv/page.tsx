          Developed REST API, back-office, and mobile apps for in-show and
          out-of-show gaming experiences. Features include QR code scanning at
          participating venues for prizes, including circus tickets, and live
          voting during performances. Expanded concept to additional circuses,
          including the International Festival of Massy and the Festival of
          Tours. Utilized Symfony for API, React for back-office, and React
          Native for mobile apps, available on PlayStore and Apple Store. Next
          year, we extended platform to support non-circus partners, revamping
          backend for flexible game modules, improved UX, and augmented reality
          features (Vuforia/Unity). Used Symfony 4 and MongoDB for backend,
          React and AntDesign for back-office, and React Native/Expo for mobile
          apps. Integrated live draw feature with Node.js and Socket.io for
          dynamic quiz experiences.
